  "description": "As a college student, it is hard to find time to do all that you have to do in a week. With all that college students have to do, one of the first things to be forgotten about is cooking and eating a decent meal. We try, but finding a fast, cheap recipe takes time, and once we find one, we don't want to be stuck eating that same meal everyday. I have found myself copying quick recipes into the notes on my phone to try to have them together in a single location. So I am developing a website that allows you to easily save, organize and share recipes! Perfect for those who don't have time to spend looking for new recipes and then copying them into a disorganized file.",
